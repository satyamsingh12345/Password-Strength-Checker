# Password-Strength-CheckerA password strength checker evaluates the strength of a password based on certain criteria such as length, complexity, and unpredictability. Below is a simple Python implementation of a password strength checker:

Features:
Checks length (minimum 8 characters).
Verifies if it contains:
  Uppercase letters
  Lowercase letters
  Digits
  Special characters.
Rates the password as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
codes
How It Works:
Length Check: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
Character Variety: Verifies the presence of uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.
Criteria Count: Rates the password based on how many of these criteria are met.
You can expand this by adding checks for:

Avoiding common words (e.g., "password", "12345").
Checking for keyboard patterns (e.g., "qwerty", "abcd").
Adding entropy calculations for better assessment.
